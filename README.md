# Global-Emissions-Analysis

### Description

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of global emissions, exploring the interplay between CO₂ output, economic growth, population trends, and energy consumption. The analyses are based on a dataset compiled and curated by the repository author, available [here](https://github.com/lobosi/energy_dataset). Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, the repository offers both aggregate and per-capita perspectives, highlighting key patterns and relationships that inform our understanding of environmental impact and sustainability.

### Content

**CO2_emission.ipynb**: Presents a comprehensive analysis of global CO₂ emissions, utilizing data visualization techniques to highlight trends and anomalies over time.

**Consumption.ipynb**: Focuses on the patterns of energy consumption worldwide, examining how different regions' energy usage correlates with their emissions profiles.

**GDP.ipynb**: Investigates the economic aspect by analyzing how GDP growth influences emissions, considering factors like industrialization and technological advancements.

**Population.ipynb**: Explores demographic factors, assessing how population growth and urbanization contribute to increased emissions.

**Prod.ipynb**: Analyzes emissions stemming from industrial production, identifying key sectors that contribute significantly to global emissions.

**ei_capita.ipynb**: Calculates emissions per capita, offering insights into individual countries' environmental footprints relative to their populations.

**ei_gdp.ipynb**: Examines the emissions intensity in relation to GDP, providing a measure of economic efficiency concerning environmental impact.


**Important Note**: I am not a climate scientist. This repository reflects my personal exploration of global emissions data as part of my ongoing development in data science and analytical skills. The analyses presented are intended for educational purposes and should not be interpreted as expert climate research.
